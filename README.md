## Description

This note-taking application allows the user to create, view, update, and delete notes from a JSON file that acts as a simple database. It uses express to create a simple API that performs CRUD operations on the database.

## Usage

1. Click the "Get Started" button on the home page to begin viewing notes.
2. Enter text describing the note in the "Note Text" field. Note saving will only be enabled once there is text in both the Note Title and Note Text fields.
3. IF you are satisfied with your note, click the SAVE icon on the site header. If the note was saved successfully, it will be rendered as a selectable option in the side panel.
4. Click any of the notes displayed in the side panel to view that note. This note can be edited at any time, but it will not be saved unless you click the SAVE icon.
5. Click the EDIT icon on the site header or the PLUS button on the sidebar to begin creating a new note. Notes created in this way will not be added to the database until you click the SAVE icon.
6. Click the DELETE icon next to any note in the sidebar to remove it from the database.
